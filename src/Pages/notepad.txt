1. Batching State Updates for Performance
React batches multiple setState calls into a single update for performance reasons. 
When your component's state changes, React doesn't immediately re-render the component. 
Instead, it waits to see if there are any other changes or updates it needs to process. 
By doing this, React minimizes the number of re-renders and diff calculations, 
which are expensive operations, thus boosting the application's performance. 
If setState were synchronous, each state update would trigger a separate re-render, which could lead to performance issues, 
especially for complex applications.

2. Consistency in State Transitions
React aims to ensure consistency in the UI. By making setState asynchronous, 
React can accumulate all state changes and apply them just before the main rendering process. 
This ensures that all components are updated based on the latest state, maintaining consistency across the UI.
 If setState were synchronous, intermediate states could lead to inconsistent rendering,
  where different parts of the UI might appear to be out of sync with each other.

  Public Class Fields Syntax: An alternative approach that's become popular due to its succinctness
   is using class fields with arrow functions. Arrow functions don't have their own this context;
    they inherit this from the surrounding scope, which, in the case of React components, is the component instance.
